A wonderful serenity has taken <b>possession</b> of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my <b><i>whole heart</i></b>. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was <i>created for the bliss of <b>souls</b> like mine</i>. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely <i>valley teems</i> with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image.
